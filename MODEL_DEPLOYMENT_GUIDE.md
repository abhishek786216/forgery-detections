# Model Deployment Guide for Streamlit Cloud

## Problem: Streamlit Cloud uses Demo Model
Your Streamlit Cloud app is using the demo model because the trained model files (`checkpoints/best_model.pth`) are not available in the cloud environment.

## Why This Happens:
1. **Git Limitation**: Model files are excluded by `.gitignore` (too large for Git)
2. **Cloud Environment**: Streamlit Cloud can't access your local files
3. **File Size**: Trained models are typically 50-500MB+

## Solutions to Load Real Model in Cloud:

### Option 1: GitHub Releases (Recommended) üöÄ

1. **Create a Release on GitHub:**
   ```bash
   # Create a release tag
   git tag -a v1.0 -m "Initial model release"
   git push origin v1.0
   ```

2. **Upload Model File:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/abhishek786216/forgery-detections/releases
   - Click "Create a new release"
   - Choose tag "v1.0"
   - Drag & drop your `best_model.pth` file
   - Publish release

3. **Update Code:**
   - Get the download URL from the release
   - Add it to the `model_urls` list in `streamlit_app.py`:
   ```python
   model_urls = [
       "https://github.com/abhishek786216/forgery-detections/releases/download/v1.0/best_model.pth",
   ]
   ```

### Option 2: Google Drive üìÅ

1. **Upload to Google Drive:**
   - Upload `checkpoints/best_model.pth` to Google Drive
   - Right-click ‚Üí "Get link" ‚Üí "Anyone with link can view"

2. **Get Direct Download Link:**
   - Original link: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing`
   - Direct link: `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID&export=download`

3. **Add to Code:**
   ```python
   model_urls = [
       "https://drive.google.com/uc?id=YOUR_FILE_ID&export=download",
   ]
   ```

### Option 3: Dropbox üì¶

1. **Upload to Dropbox**
2. **Share and modify URL:**
   - Change `?dl=0` to `?dl=1` at the end
3. **Add to model_urls list**

### Option 4: Hugging Face Hub ü§ó

1. **Create account on huggingface.co**
2. **Create model repository**
3. **Upload model file**
4. **Use Hugging Face URLs**

## Current App Behavior:

### ‚úÖ **Demo Model Features:**
- **Consistent Results**: Same image always gives same prediction
- **Realistic Patterns**: Simulates different forgery types
- **Edge Detection**: Mimics tampering around edges
- **Central Forgery**: Detects copy-paste in image center
- **Scattered Regions**: Multiple suspicious areas

### üéØ **Enhanced Demo Analysis:**
```
Pattern Types:
- Type 0: Mostly authentic (low uniform values)
- Type 1: Central forgery (higher center values) 
- Type 2: Edge tampering (suspicious edges)
- Type 3: Scattered suspicious regions
```

## Quick Implementation Steps:

### Step 1: Upload Model (Choose One)
```bash
# Option A: GitHub Release
1. Create release on GitHub
2. Upload best_model.pth
3. Copy download URL

# Option B: Google Drive  
1. Upload to Drive
2. Get shareable link
3. Convert to direct download URL
```

### Step 2: Update Code
Edit `streamlit_app.py`, find this section:
```python
model_urls = [
    # Add your model URLs here when you upload them
    # "https://github.com/abhishek786216/forgery-detections/releases/download/v1.0/best_model.pth",
]
```

Replace with your actual URL:
```python
model_urls = [
    "YOUR_ACTUAL_MODEL_URL_HERE",
]
```

### Step 3: Deploy Update
```bash
git add streamlit_app.py
git commit -m "Add model download URL for cloud deployment"  
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Test Cloud App
- Visit your Streamlit Cloud app
- Should show "Downloading model from cloud storage..."
- Then "‚úÖ Real model loaded successfully!"

## Model File Locations:
```
Local:     checkpoints/best_model.pth (309MB - excluded from Git)
Cloud:     Downloads from URL ‚Üí checkpoints/best_model.pth
GitHub:    Releases section (separate from code repository)
```

## Troubleshooting:

### If Download Fails:
- Check URL accessibility
- Verify file permissions (public access)
- Check file size limits (GitHub: 100MB, Drive: unlimited)

### If Model Loading Fails:
- App falls back to enhanced demo mode
- Check model architecture compatibility
- Verify PyTorch version compatibility

## Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Enhanced demo model active
- ‚úÖ Cloud compatibility fixes applied
- ‚è≥ Waiting for model URL configuration
- üéØ Ready for real model deployment

Once you upload your model and add the URL, users will get the full trained model experience in the cloud! üöÄ
